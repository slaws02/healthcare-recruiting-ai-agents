# Healthcare Recruiting AI Agents — Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a portfolio suite of AI recruiting workflow agents designed to support healthcare talent acquisition, sourcing, screening, and candidate engagement processes.

These agents demonstrate how guardrailed AI can assist recruiters with structured intake, sourcing strategy, credential screening, outreach personalization, and hard-to-fill market mapping — using repeatable, auditable workflows instead of generic text generation.

All examples use synthetic, portfolio-safe scenarios. No proprietary client data, ATS data, or candidate PII is included.
